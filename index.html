        <h2>What is the Golden Ratio?</h2>
          <p>
            In short words, it's a mathematical ratio, commonly found in nature. It can be used to create organic-looking,
            visually-pleasing compositions in your artwork or design projects, and is useful for graphic designers, illustrators and
            digital artists. Also known as the Golden Mean, The Golden Section or the Greek letter phi, it can be deployed to bring
            structure and harmony to your projects.

        <h2>Fibonacci Number</h2>

          <p>
            Closely related to the Fibonacci Sequence (which you may remember from either your school maths lessons or Dan Brown's
            The Da Vinci Code), the Golden Ratio describes the perfectly symmetrical relationship between two proportions. Nowadays, the Fibonacci sequence also has applications in financial market analysis, computer science, and game theory.
          </p>
        <h2>Golden Rectangle</h2>
          <p>the Golden Ratio can be illustrated using a Golden Rectangle. This is a rectangle where, if you cut off a square (side
          length equal to the shortest side of the rectangle), the rectangle that's left will have the same proportions as the
          original rectangle</p>
